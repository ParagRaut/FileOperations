# FileOperations
This is my first meaningful little Python2 program which does some basic file handling operations.

This program was written in January of 2015 as a demo of what I've learned.

I found this incredible piece of code in an archive while going through my old hardrive backup.

This program albeit not so special for anyone else, holds special place in my heart
